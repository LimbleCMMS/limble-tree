# Limble Tree

An Angular library for building visual tree structures. Built and used by the team at [Limble](https://limblecmms.com/);

This library is currently a work in progress. It may not be suitable for production environments yet.

## Installation and Usage

See our [NPM page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@limble/limble-tree)

## Development and Contributions

Contributions from the community are welcome. If you find an issue or have an idea, submit it on our Github issues page.

For local development, simply clone the repository and run `npm ci` to install dependencies.

This repository contains the limble-tree library as well as a sandbox application for utilizing the library locally. To serve the limble-tree, run `npm run dev:limble-tree`. To serve the sandbox, run `npm run dev:sandbox`. (Note that in order for hot reloading to function properly between the two projects, Angular requires that limble-tree be served first, followed by the sandbox.)
